	You can buy a good hamburger at a number of places, but you can only get Louisville’s Best Hamburger at W. W. Cousins.<br>
We opened W. W. Cousins in 1983 with the concept of everything made from scratch and cooked to order. And then, to make it even better, we added 40 different toppings so you can make your burger just how you want!<br>
 
We have won Best of Louisville from readers of Louisville Magazine every time the best hamburger category has run. Plus, we have been selected as Kentucky’s Best Hamburger by Food Network Magazine.<br>
 
All our buns are made fresh here in our bakery every day, as are our pies and cookies.<br>
 
We offer only the best and freshest ingredients on our toppings bar and salad bar.<br>
 
We also offer a nice selection of local and imported beer and soft drinks.<br>
 
Come visit us often. You won’t leave hungry!<br>
